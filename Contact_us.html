	<h2> About Us </h2>
	<h3> History </h3>
	Durham House of Pets wasn't always this big! We started out in a tiny shop downtown way back in 1978. We only sold dogs and cats back then. Things were great and business was booming, so we had to expand into our current building and have been here since 1986.<br>
	<h3> Why use us for your pet needs?</h3>
	We are a full service pet store specializing in dogs, cats and snakes. Our focus is on their needs and we've been doing it for a long time. <br>
	You will not find the type of customer service we provide in a chain store!
